## Abstract
The intermittency of the wind resource and limitation of wind turbines (WT) create underutilization of wind power and a significant barrier to the dispatchability of WT. The industrial solutions to mitigate these issues are to improve turbine electronics and to integrate either storage or a gas turbine with a large regulation capacity to a wind farm. This paper proposes a novel configuration, i.e., a compressed-air-assisted wind turbine (CA-WT), to recycle the mechanical spillage and refill the capacity vacancy, which increases the total generation, capacity factor, and dispatchability of WT. The proposed CA-WT integrates an adaptive structure, which is composed of a continuous variable transmission, variable displacement machine, and air tank, to mitigate the deviation between wind energy and load. We develop systematic models and regulation strategies for each component of the dispatchable CA-WT. Case studies are conducted to compare the performance between the CA-WT and WT in the autonomous and grid-connection operation. The results show that the proposed system improves the generation by 39.2$\%$, and increases the wind energy penetration rate from 68.57$\%$ to 97.08$\%$ in the autonomous operation. For the grid-connection operation, the proposed system increase the wind electricity penetration level from 19.12 $\%$ to 23.57$\%$.

## Implementation

We shall upload the code in near future.
